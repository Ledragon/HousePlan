# HousePlan
This application is intended as a (not so) simple way to draw plans. It was originally created because I wanted to draw a plan of my house, and wanted to do so using d3.

The only browser dependency is d3js.

# Caution
This app uses ES6 promises without any polyfill, meaning that you need to use a browser compatible with that feature.
